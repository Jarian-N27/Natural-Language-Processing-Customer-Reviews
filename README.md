# Natural-Language-Processing-Customer-Reviews

# NLP Project: [Project Name]

🚧 **This README is a work in progress. Updates will be made soon.** 🚧

## 📌 Project Overview
This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze sentiment in customer reviews and classify them to be positive, neutral, or negative
Using state-of-the-art NLP techniques, the system processes, analyzes, and extracts meaningful insights from textual data.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **NLP Libraries:** [e.g., Hugging Face Transformers, spaCy, NLTK, Gensim]
- **Machine Learning Frameworks:** [e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn]
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Vectorization & Embeddings:** [e.g., Word2Vec, BERT, OpenAI API]
- **Deployment:** [e.g., Flask, FastAPI, Streamlit, Docker]


## 🚀 Features & Implementation
- **[Feature 1]**: [Brief explanation of what it does, e.g., "Classifies text into predefined categories using fine-tuned BERT."]
- **[Feature 2]**: [Brief explanation, e.g., "Generates text summaries using extractive summarization."]
- **[Feature 3]**: [Brief explanation, e.g., "Utilizes Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract key entities."]

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted **data cleaning, tokenization, and stopword removal**.
- Visualized **word frequency distributions, word clouds, and topic modeling results**.
- Ensured data quality and relevance for model training.

## 📈 Model Training & Evaluation
- Implemented **[model name]** for NLP processing.
- Trained models on **[dataset name]**, achieving **[performance metric]** accuracy.
- Evaluated models using **precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix**.
